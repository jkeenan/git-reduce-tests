=head1 NAME

Git::Reduce::Tests -  Create a branch with fewer test files for faster development

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Git::Reduce::Tests;

    my $self = Git::Reduce::Tests->new($params);
    my $reduced_branch = $self->prepare_reduced_branch();
    $self->push_to_remote($reduced_branch);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Git::Reduce::Tests holds the implementation for command-line utility
F<reduce-tests>, which is stored in this distribution's F<scripts/> directory.
See that program's documentation (available after installation via C<perldoc
reduce-tests>) or the F<README> for an explanation of that program's
functionality.

This package exports no functions.

=head1 METHODS

Git::Reduce::Tests is currently structured as three publicly available methods
intended to be called in sequence.

=head2 C<new()>

=over 4

=item * Purpose

Git::Reduce::Tests constructor.  Checks that the directory passed to the
C<--dir> option is a git repository and that there are no files there with a
modified status.

=item * Arguments

    $self = Git::Reduce::Tests->new($params);

Reference to a hash of parameters, typically that provided by
C<Git::Reduce::Tests::Opts::process_options()>.  See that package's
documentation for a description of those parameters.

=item * Return Value

Git::Reduce::Tests object.

=back

=cut

sub new {
    my ($class, $params) = @_;
    my %data;

    while (my ($k,$v) = each %{$params}) {
        $data{params}{$k} = $v;
    }
    $data{git} = Git::Wrapper->new($params->{dir});

    # Make sure we can check out the branch needing testing.
    check_status(\%data);
    {
        local $@;
        eval {$data{git}->checkout($data{params}->{branch}) };
        croak($@) if $@;
    }
    return bless \%data, $class;
}

=head2 C<prepare_reduced_branch()>

=over 4

=item * Purpose

Creates a new branch whose name is that of the starting branch either (a)
prepended with the value of the C<--prefix> option or (b) appended with the
value of the C<--suffix> option -- but not B<both> (a) and (b).  C<--prefix>
is given preference and defaults to C<reduced_>.

The method then reduces the size of that branch's test suite either by
specifying a limited number of files to be B<included> in the test suite --
the comma-delimited argument to the C<--include> option -- or by specifying
those files to be B<excluded> from the test suite -- the comma-delimited
argument to the C<--exclude> option.

=item * Arguments

    $reduced_branch = $self->prepare_reduced_branch();

None.

=item * Return Value

String containing the name of the new branch with smaller test suite.

}

=head2 C<push_to_remote()>

=over 4

=item * Purpose

Push the reduced branch to the remote specified in the C<--remote> option,
which defaults to C<origin>.  This, of course, assumes that the user has
permission to perform that action, has proper credentials such as SSH keys,
etc.

=item * Arguments

    $self->push_to_remote($reduced_branch);

String holding name of branch with reduced test suite -- typically the return
value of the C<prepare_reduced_branch()> method.

=item * Return Value

Implicitly returns a true value upon success.
