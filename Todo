TODO list for Perl module Git::Reduce::Tests

Tues night: Released v0.05.  Since we can now get coverage stats on
prepare_reduced_branch(), write additional tests.  Up $VERSION and modify
Changes; then release v0.06.  Test non-verbose output, thereby boosting branch
coverage.  Acknowledge genehack and Owen in POD.
