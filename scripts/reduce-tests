=head1 NAME

reduce-tests - Create a branch with fewer test files for faster development

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  reduce-tests \
    --dir=/path/to/git/workdir \
    --include=t/90-load.t,t/91-unload.t \
    --branch=master \
    --prefix=smoke-me \
    --remote=origin \
    --verbose

=head1 DESCRIPTION

F<reduce-tests> is a command-line utility which will be useful in the
following situation:

=over 4

=item *

You have a Perl library stored in a git repository.

=item *

You have a large test suite for that library which takes a non-trivial length
of time to run.

=item *

You wish to run only a subset of those tests.

=back

F<reduce-tests> enables you to copy a branch, remove files from that
branch's test suite and run that reduced test suite.  The test suite may be
reduced either by:

=over 4

=item *

Specifying only those test files you wish to include
(C<include=t/firstfile,t/secondfile>); or

=item *

Specifying all the test files you wish to exclude
(C<exclude=t/thirdfile,t/fourthfile>).

=back

This program is likely to be particularly useful in the situation where:

=over 4

=item *

You are required to push all branches to a smoke server for testing.

=item *

That smoke-testing is activated by prefixing your remote branch with a
string which your smoke-server recognizes as a request for a smoke run.

=item *

The smoke server is taking an inordinately long time to complete its test runs
and/or is reporting failures in test files which you cannot reproduce in your
development environment (I<heisenfails>).  If you have no immediate control
over that smoke server, you can at least speed up your development cycle by
running only the part of the test suite you need to focus on at a given
moment.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

F<reduce-tests> is implemented by CPAN distribution Git-Reduce-Tests.  See the
documentation in Git::Reduce::Tests (available after installation, via
C<perldoc Git::Reduce::Tests> for information about reporting bugs, support,
author, copyright notice and license.
